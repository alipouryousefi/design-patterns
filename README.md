Design Patterns in JavaScript
This repository contains examples and explanations of various design patterns implemented in JavaScript. Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. Understanding and applying design patterns can lead to more maintainable, scalable, and reusable code.

In this repository, you'll find implementations of the following design patterns in JavaScript:

Singleton Pattern
Factory Pattern
Observer Pattern
Strategy Pattern
Decorator Pattern
Command Pattern
Proxy Pattern
Adapter Pattern
Template Method Pattern
and more...
Each design pattern comes with detailed explanations, code examples, and UML diagrams to help you understand the pattern's purpose, structure, and usage.

How to Use This Repository
You can clone this repository using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone git@github.com:alipouryousefi/design-patterns.git
After cloning the repository, navigate to the respective design pattern folder to explore the code examples and explanations.

Design Patterns Covered
Singleton Pattern
The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It is commonly used for managing shared resources.

Factory Pattern
The Factory pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects without specifying their concrete classes. It allows flexibility in creating objects based on the requirements.

Observer Pattern
The Observer pattern is a behavioral pattern that establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects. When one object changes state, all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically.

Strategy Pattern
The Strategy pattern allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one of them, and make them interchangeable. Clients can select the algorithm they want to use at runtime.

...

Examples
Each design pattern folder contains a README.md file that provides an overview of the pattern, its use cases, and its implementation in JavaScript. The examples folder within each pattern folder contains JavaScript code examples, along with UML diagrams for better visualization.
