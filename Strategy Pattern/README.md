The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. The pattern enables clients to choose the appropriate algorithm at runtime without modifying the client's code. This approach promotes flexibility and avoids code duplication, making it easier to extend or modify behavior.

In the example , we implemented the Strategy Pattern by creating a PaymentStrategy interface, which defines the pay method. We then created two concrete strategies: CreditCardPayment and PayPalPayment, each implementing the PaymentStrategy interface with their own payment logic.

The ShoppingCart class serves as the context and is initialized with a specific payment strategy. The checkout method in the ShoppingCart class uses the payment strategy to perform the payment based on the selected strategy.

By using the Strategy Pattern, we can easily switch between payment methods at runtime without modifying the shopping cart's code, promoting flexibility and maintainability.
