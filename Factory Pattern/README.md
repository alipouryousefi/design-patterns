The Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects without specifying their concrete classes. Instead of calling a constructor directly to create an object, the Factory pattern abstracts the object creation process into a separate method or function. This allows the client code to create objects without being concerned about the specific implementation details or classes involved.

Explanation:

1. We define a common interface Product (optional) that all concrete product classes will implement. This interface enforces a common structure for product classes, even though it's not strictly required in JavaScript.

2. We create two concrete product classes ConcreteProduct1 and ConcreteProduct2, each implementing the operation method of the Product interface.

3. The Factory class encapsulates the object creation process. It has a method createProduct that takes a type parameter and returns an instance of the appropriate concrete product based on the given type.

4. The createProduct method checks the type parameter and returns the corresponding concrete product. If an invalid type is provided, it throws an error.

5. The client code (the "Usage" section) interacts with the Factory class to create instances of the desired products without knowing the specific implementation details of the products.

The Factory pattern allows you to create objects in a centralized and flexible way. It decouples the client code from the concrete classes, making it easier to extend and maintain the codebase. It's especially useful when you have a family of related classes that share a common interface, and you want to create instances of these classes based on some conditions or configurations.
