# Observer Pattern 


The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern where an object, known as the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, known as observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes. This pattern is useful when you have one-to-many relationships between objects, and you want to decouple the subject from its observers, allowing for a flexible and maintainable codebase.

In the example, we implemented the Observer Pattern using a NewsPublisher as the subject (observable) and NewsSubscriber as the observer. The NewsPublisher maintains a list of observers and notifies them when news is published using the notifyObservers method. The NewsSubscriber has an update method that gets called when it receives news from the publisher.

This decoupling allows for easy addition or removal of observers without affecting the publisher's code. The Observer Pattern is helpful in scenarios where you need to keep multiple objects in sync with a subject's state changes, such as event handling, user interfaces, and notification systems.
