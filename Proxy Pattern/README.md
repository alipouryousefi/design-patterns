# Proxy Pattern


The Proxy Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object. It acts as an intermediary or wrapper for the target object, controlling access to it and allowing additional behavior to be added without modifying the target object's code. The Proxy Pattern is particularly useful for scenarios like lazy loading, access control, caching, logging, and more.

Example:
Suppose we have an expensive database operation represented by the Database class. We want to create a proxy to cache the results of the database query and avoid repeated expensive operations.

we have a Database class representing an expensive database operation (in this example, it's simulated with a simple string). We then create a DatabaseProxy class, which acts as a proxy for the Database class.

The DatabaseProxy class has an instance of the Database class and a cachedData property to store the cached results. When the getData() method of the DatabaseProxy is called, it first checks if the data is cached (cachedData is not null). If it is, it returns the cached data. Otherwise, it calls the getData() method of the real Database class, stores the result in cachedData, and then returns it.



The Proxy Pattern allows us to control access to the real object and add additional features without modifying its code directly. It's a powerful pattern that can be used to implement various functionalities such as caching, logging, security, and lazy loading in your applications.
