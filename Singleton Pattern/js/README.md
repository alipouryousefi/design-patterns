 the Singleton Pattern is a design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It is useful when you want to restrict the instantiation of a class to a single object, and you want to make sure that all components in your application use the same instance.

To create a Singleton in JavaScript, we can use a closure to create a private variable that holds the instance of the class. We then provide a function that returns the instance, creating it if it doesn't exist, or returning the existing instance if it has already been created.

By using the Singleton Pattern, you can ensure that only one instance of the class exists throughout the lifetime of your application. This is particularly useful when you want to share resources or data across different parts of your codebase without the overhead of creating multiple instances.
