The Singleton pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance throughout the application. It is commonly used when you need to control the instantiation of a class to prevent multiple instances from being created, especially for resources that should be shared across the application.
Explanation:

1.We define a class called Singleton. In the constructor, we check if the instance already exists (by checking if Singleton.instance is truthy). If it does, we return the existing instance instead of creating a new one. This ensures that only one instance is ever created.

2.The data property (replace it with any shared resource you want to manage) holds the data that the singleton class is responsible for.

3.We use a static property Singleton.instance to hold the single instance of the class. Static properties are properties associated with the class itself, rather than individual instances.

4.When we create an instance of the Singleton class, the constructor checks if the Singleton.instance exists. If it does, the constructor returns the existing instance, effectively preventing the creation of additional instances.

5.When we use new Singleton(), both instance1 and instance2 will be the same object. Any changes made to the instance will be reflected in both variables because they reference the same instance.

The Singleton pattern can be useful in scenarios where you want to ensure that multiple instances of a class don't exist, and you need to share the same instance across different parts of your application. However, be cautious when using the Singleton pattern, as it can introduce global state and make testing more challenging. It's essential to carefully consider whether the Singleton pattern is the most appropriate solution for your specific use case.
