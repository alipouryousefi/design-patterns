The Singleton Pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It is useful when you want to restrict the instantiation of a class to a single object, and you want to make sure that all components in your application use the same instance.

In TypeScript, we can implement the Singleton Pattern using a combination of a private constructor and a static method to retrieve the single instance. Here's how you can create a Singleton in TypeScript:

Step 1: Create the Singleton Class
Define a class with a private static property to store the single instance and a private constructor to prevent direct instantiation of the class.

Step 2: Use the Singleton
Now you can use the getInstance method to get the single instance of the class. Calling this method will either create a new instance if it doesn't exist or return the existing instance if it has already been created.

By using the Singleton Pattern, you can ensure that only one instance of the class exists throughout the lifetime of your application. This is particularly useful when you want to share resources or data across different parts of your codebase without the overhead of creating multiple instances. Keep in mind that while Singletons have their uses, they can also introduce tight coupling and make unit testing more challenging, so use them judiciously.
