# Prototype Pattern

The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype, without making the code dependent on their classes. This pattern is particularly useful when creating instances of a complex object that may have multiple configurations but shares much of the same data.

In both the JavaScript and TypeScript implementations, we define a prototype object (carPrototype) with common properties and methods for creating car objects. Then, we create new car objects (car1 and car2) by cloning the prototype using Object.create(). This way, we avoid creating separate classes for each car configuration and keep the code more flexible and maintainable.
